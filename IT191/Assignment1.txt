	To start I would finish my degree in Information System: Security. A lot of the job postings I've seen have a bachelors as one of the preferred requirements if not required ones. Some of the postings I've seen that don't require it would like it if you had 3-5 years of experience doing security already. Sadly I can't say that I have official knowledge, but between my security classes and a few capture the flag events I would say that I have a good base understanding of a lot of tools that are used in the industry. I've also started doing some pen-testing and malware analysis with some coworkers, but sadly it's off the books and I can't put it down as job experience, but I have it written down in my skills section of my resume saying I've done some unofficial pen-testing. Some thing I've started doing on my own knowing that the university wouldn't teach me. For example I installed Debian 8 as my primary OS and forced myself to use Linux daily, and it turns out I enjoy using it way more than the other operating systems out there. Based off some of the news articles I've read recently it seems as if there is a shortage of skilled Linux professionals in any field. So coming into the job with a good understanding of how to use and maintain a Linux system would help me be more flexible when it came to security. Not only could I do everything I've learned on Windows, but since I can do most of it on Linux, which also translates into OS X in some situations, it hopefully would show the potential employer that I have the drive to go above and beyond the average canidate. I was also learning Python over break due to it's usability and flexibility when it came to security. I feel like what I know, and what I will be learning this semester will qualify me for an internship over the summer. Ideally I'll get an internship at either Country Financial or State Farm, and that would turn into a job upon graduating. Once I get into a security job I know that I will excel at it and gain the needed skills to advance in the job market. One thing I've always done is keeping my resume up to date. I've changed it after every semester with what new skills I've learned, and even sometimes beyond that when I learn something that I feel should be put on right away.
